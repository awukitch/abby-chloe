<!-- Idea: I was messing around with the colors and the yellow, light blue, and white seem to work well together. The side bar from the prevous website is also cute. Maybe we could make the headers hot pink to match the little specks in the side bar. If that's too bold in terms of color, maybe we could maybe add simple pink dividers/organizational lines instead. What do you think?

    <H2> What is cancer? </H2>
    <p> Cancer is a disease that occurs when mutated cells grow uncontrollably resulting in the invasion of healthy cells.
 </p>

    <H2> Why is childhood cancer different? </H2>
    <p> Childhood cancer can differ from adult cancer in terms of cause, treatment, and effect on the individual's lifestyle. In children, cancer often develops as the result of genetic mutations which occur before the child's birth. On the other hand, adult cancer is often easier detected due to a range of factors, including life choices like smoking. 
    Radiation treatment such as chemotherapy also affects children differently than adults. Although children's bodies often respond to chemo quicker, it can cause a wide range of long term side effects (infertility, sstunted growth, etc.) which affect the child for the rest of his/her life. This can cause mental disorders including depression and anxiety, therfore it is important that the child has access to both physical and mental help alike.
